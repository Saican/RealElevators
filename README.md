Realistic Movement Functions for ZDoom Elevator Constructs

Custom ACS functions that will move both "standard" Doom elevators and 3D floor-based elevators in a realistic fashion.

These functions do not have any impact on the base games, whatsoever.  These functions are a resource for modders.

This code is provided as an uncompiled ACS library.
